# Medical_pager
The application provides users with the ability to create channels and groups based on
their medical interests, allowing for easy communication and collaboration. Utilized
modern front-end technologies, including React, to ensure a seamless user experience.
Implemented a back-end server using Node.js and Express to manage user requests and
handle data processing.
